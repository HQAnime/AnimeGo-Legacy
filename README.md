**This is not official**

This is just a practise app made with react native and it is also my first react native app.
This app works for **UWP** and **Android**. IOS is partially supported but more styling will be needed.
Use [AnimeGo-Re](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/tree/85753e37de4023f038b591de7d832445a0eb55a3) instead.

如果你喜歡中文字幕的話，可以嘗試[AnimeOne](https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeOne)。

## What could it do
- New release
- New season
- Movie & Popular anime
- Schedule list
- ToWatch list
- Genre list
- Search anime
- No popups while watching anime (wip)

A complete rework is undergoing because AnimeOne doesn't have some old animes. Flutter might be used instead of React Native. I am a bit confused about what I should use. Native is the best but I don't have the time to do it. 

## How to run this project
### Android

UWP will no longer be supported

## How to install
### **Android**
Download from [release](https://github.com/HenryQuan/React-Native-GoGoAnime/releases)

This app could be updated easily inside settings
### **IOS**
Please link all libraries and change all stylings so that it fits IOS. It could run on your device for **7 days** without developer account or forever with one
